title: Responsible gun rights

# The Challenge

The state of Washington faces an intersection of public interests. 

The violent use of guns causes severe rates of death and injury to children and adults in our communities. This gun violence kills or injures citizens in our communities almost every day. The magnitude and frequency of the gun violence threatens the security of our State and violates the security of its people.

At the same time, the state of Washington must protect and promote the rights described by the 2nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Citizens of the state of Washington reasonably expect that the 2nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides them with a right to keep and bear Arms in the context of a well regulated Militia. The state of Washington must protect and promote that right.

# The Opportunities

The opportunities to be realized:

* Responsible proponents of gun rights can live in a state in which their rights to keep and bear Arms are bolstered and supported by the state government, even above and beyond the status quo.
* Simultaneously, with the same mechanisms for bolstering and supporting 2nd Amendment rights, the state of Washington can address many of the problems that lead to severe rates of death and injury due to gun violence. 

# The Context = The U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights

*Amendment II*

A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

# A Disclaimer

The strategy described here will have a meaningful impact, but it is not advertised to be "the one" grand and golden solution to all of the problems of gun violence. It's often the case that difficult problems require multiple solutions that approach from various angles. This strategy supports and bolsters other initiatives that also aim to reduce gun violence in our communities.
