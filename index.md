# The Challenge

The state of Washington faces an intersection of public interests. The violent use of guns causes severe rates of death and injury to children and adults in our communities. The case for government action is so clear and plain that one can only reasonably question the negligent inaction that is so disturbingly embraced by the status quo.

What makes inaction so easy to embrace is a lazy interpretation of the 2nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. This laziness takes two forms:

* Responsible proponents of gun rights fail to imagine a society in which their rights could be bolstered and supported by the government of the state of Washington, even above and beyond the status quo, in the course of the state simultaneously pursuing its compelling interest in addressing the problem of severe rates of death and injury due to gun violence. 
* Proponents of measures that could reduce gun violence fail to imagine a systemic approach that promotes the right of responsible people to keep and bear arms, while simultaneously implementing measures that address the root causes of gun violence in our communities.

# The U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights

Amendment II
A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.
